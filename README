logrun - Executes actions when a certain regexp has been found in a logfile
===========================================================================

In its basic form logrun looks for various authentication failures and adds
firewall rules to DROP IP packets from annoying visitors. Anyone familiar with
(Perl) regexps easily modifies the code to do whatever desirable.

Failed authentication will add the callers IP to a database, counting the number
of failed attempts.  After too many attempts, the client IP address is dropped,
thus terminating any communication between the server and the client.  A passed
authentication clears any entries from the database.

Configure /etc/logrun.conf to suit your needs, and feel free to make additional
rules in the code.

To install, simply run the below line as root:

  perl INSTALL
