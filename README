logrun - Executes actions when a certain regexp has been found in a logfile
===========================================================================

In its basic form it looks for various authentication failures and adds
firewall rules to DROP IP packets from anoying visitors. Anyone familiar 
to (Perl) regexps easily modifies the code to do whatever desirable.

Failed authentication will add the callers IP in a log, counting the number
of failed attempts. If too many, the communication is DROP:ed, a passed
authentication will clear the entries from the log.

Please configure /etc/logrun.conf to your needs, and feel free to make
additional rules in the code.

To install, run as root

  perl INSTALL

Feel free!
